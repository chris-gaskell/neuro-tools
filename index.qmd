**Welcome to NeuroPsyTools!**

I created this space to bring together the [web apps](pages/apps.qmd) I’ve developed for my clinical neuropsychology practice. While doing that, I thought it would also be cool to compile a directory of external [resources](pages/resources.qmd) showcasing the fantastic contributions others have made over the years.

If you have any suggestions for new web apps or know of any great resources to add to the directory, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:chris-gaskell@hotmail.co.uk). I'm always up for exciting new projects and collaborations!

I’ve got some ideas for future additions (like blogs, cheat sheets, and more), but I won’t get ahead of myself. Writing and programming take time, so updates may not happen frequently — but stay tuned!

And if you like what you see - please share! ♥️
