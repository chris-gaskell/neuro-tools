title: "Reliable Change"
description: "Calculate reliable change indices (RCIs) for neuropsychological tests to assess significant changes in cognitive performance over time. A range of methodological approaches, such as standard regression-based (SRB) models, which help to account for practice effects and regression to the mean are included. These methods ensure that changes observed in test scores are meaningful and not due to measurement error."
